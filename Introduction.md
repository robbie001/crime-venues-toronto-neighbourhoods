## Problem ##
When moving to a new city, how do we know which neighbourhoods are safe?

## Background ##
When I was planning a move to the city of Edmonton, Alberta, I had difficulties determining the safety of its neighbourhoods. The online advice from locals appeared subjective and anecdotal. One contributor posited that any neighbourhood with a Walmart was unsafe. 

To find a safe and comfortable neighbourhood to live in, I needed to visit the city and explore a number of different areas. I looked at homes and observed the surrounding neighbourhoods. I drove the back alleys behind the homes of interest. I even visited the area during at nighttime to observe any changes. That took time and money, and the approach was not very scientific. In the end, I was not certain that my safety assessment would be correct.

I ended up choosing a neighbourhood that happened to be 4 kilometres (2.5 miles) from a Walmart, and have had no troubles with crime. However, building on the Walmart contributor’s claim, I want to address a key question: can we predict the safety of a neighbourhood by the type of venues in it?

## Usefulness ##
If there is a correlation between the venues and the crime rate of a neighbourhood, it could be useful for people who are moving to a new city. They could narrow their search for neighbourhoods to live in, and unlike me, could save money and use their time more efficiently. 

This information may also help tourists who want to avoid areas that are less safe. 

City officials may find it useful, as well. When planning zones for a neighbourhood, they could avoid certain combinations of venues that correlate with higher crime, or inversely, plan for venues that correlate with lower crime.
